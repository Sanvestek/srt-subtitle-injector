# Simple Subtitle Injector (Chrome Extension)

A minimal, proof-of-concept Chrome Extension designed to inject **locally stored SRT subtitles** directly into any standard HTML5 video player, including those embedded within iframes. This extension leverages the native `HTMLMediaElement` API to add a new subtitle track, integrating cleanly into the player's existing controls rather than relying on a custom, monitored overlay.

This is currently a **demonstration** project intended to prove the viability of injecting subtitles without external services or heavy monitoring scripts, particularly useful for custom or embedded players where official subtitle tracks are missing.

## Features

* **Native Integration:** Subtitles appear in the player's native controls menu (usually the "CC" button).
* **Iframe Support:** Uses `all_frames: true` to target video players inside cross-origin iframes.
* **SRT to VTT Conversion:** Converts the uploaded `.srt` file content to the browser-required WebVTT format on the fly.
* **Zero Monitoring:** No separate overlay or constant position tracking needed once the track is injected.

## Install and Use

Since this is an **unpacked Chrome Extension**, follow these steps to test it in your browser:

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Simple-Subtitle-Injector.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Simple-Subtitle-Injector.git)
    ```
2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:**
    * Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your browser.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:**
    * Toggle the **Developer mode** switch (usually in the top right corner) to **ON**.
4.  **Load Unpacked Extension:**
    * Click the **Load unpacked** button.
    * Select the root directory of the cloned repository (`Simple-Subtitle-Injector`).
5.  *(Optional)* **Pin the Icon:** Click the puzzle piece icon on your toolbar and pin the extension for easy access.

### Usage

1.  Navigate to a webpage containing an HTML5 video player (including the embedded player you were testing).
2.  Click the **Simple Subtitle Injector** extension icon on your toolbar.
3.  Click the **Choose File** button and select a local `.srt` subtitle file.
4.  The script will attempt to inject the subtitles into the first detected `<video>` element on the page/iframe.
5.  Check the video player's subtitle menu (the "CC" button) to select your "Custom SRT" track if it doesnot automatically appear.
6.  Turning subtitles off on the player may require the srt file to be injected again via the extension popup in order for subtitles to reappear (This is something planned for fixing in near future)

## Key Components

| File | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| `manifest.json` | Configuration; sets `all_frames: true` for iframe access. |
| `popup.html`/`.js` | Handles user interaction, file reading, and the **SRT to VTT conversion**. |
| `content.js` | Runs inside the webpage/iframe; finds the `<video>` element and uses JavaScript's `URL.createObjectURL` and `addTextTrack` to inject the subtitles natively. |

## Known Limitations (Proof-of-Concept)

* **Selector is Hard-Coded:** The `content.js` file uses a generic `video` selector. For a real application, this needs to be dynamically selected or configurable.
* **Basic SRT Parser:** The built-in `srtToVtt` function is minimal and may fail on complex or non-standard SRT files.
* **One Video Only:** Currently targets only the first `<video>` element found.
* **VTT Styling:** Does not support custom VTT features (like positioning or styling cues).

## Contributing

As this is a demonstration project, contributions are welcome, especially for:
* A more robust SRT parser.
* Dynamic video element selection logic.
* Adding support for a configuration page.

## ðŸŒŸ Polishing Your GitHub Repository

To make your repository look professional and easy for others to use and contribute to, consider these five elements:

### 1. License File (Critical for Open Source)
Create a file named **`LICENSE`** (no extension) in the root of your repository. Since this is a small utility, the **MIT License** is a common and friendly choice. It allows anyone to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software.

### 2. `.gitignore` File
Create a file named **`.gitignore`** in the root directory. This prevents unnecessary files from being tracked by Git. For this project, a basic template is sufficient:
